# Langchain Vector Search with pgvector

This project demonstrates vector similarity search using Langchain and pgvector in PostgreSQL.

## What is pgvector?

pgvector is a PostgreSQL extension that adds vector similarity search capabilities to PostgreSQL databases. It allows you to:

- Store vector embeddings directly in PostgreSQL
- Perform similarity searches using different distance metrics (Euclidean, Cosine, Inner Product)
- Create vector indexes for faster similarity searches
- Scale to millions of vectors

Key features:

- Native PostgreSQL extension - no separate vector database needed
- ACID compliance and transaction support
- Supports exact and approximate nearest neighbor search
- Multiple indexing methods (IVFFlat, HNSW)
- Integration with existing PostgreSQL tools and ecosystem

## Use Cases

Common use cases for pgvector include:

- Semantic search
- Recommendation systems  
- Image similarity search
- Document deduplication
- Natural language processing
- Machine learning feature storage

## Performance Considerations

For optimal performance with pgvector:

- Use appropriate index types based on your data size and accuracy requirements
- Consider dimensionality of vectors (lower dimensions = better performance)
- Tune PostgreSQL parameters for vector workloads
- Monitor index size and rebuild as needed
- Use batch operations for bulk vector insertions

## Getting Started

To use pgvector:

1. Install the extension:
